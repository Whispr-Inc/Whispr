# Requirements & Architecture Design

This document outlines the requirements and architecture for a scalable real-time chat application with social media
capabilities. The system follows microservice architecture principles to ensure high availability, scalability, and
performance for millions of concurrent users.


## Primary Goal

Design a microservice-based social media platform similar to Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Weibo, supporting
real-time messaging and social media posts consumption by regular end-users.


## Key Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Instant messaging with delivery and read receipts
- **Social Media Posts**: Support for image, video, and text posts
- **User Management**: Profile management and authentication
- **Content Discovery**: Feed algorithms and content recommendation

- Database Sharding: Distributed database architecture

### Availability

- Uptime: 99.9% availability (8.76 hours downtime/year)
- Fault Tolerance: Graceful degradation during failures
- Disaster Recovery: RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour
- Service Health: Real-time monitoring and alerting

### Security

- Data Encryption: End-to-end encryption for messages
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
- Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data Privacy: GDPR and CCPA compliance
- API Security: Rate limiting, input validation, SQL injection prevention
